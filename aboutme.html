    <h1>My Home Helper</h1>

    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Noor and I'm a homemaker with a growing passion for web
      design. I created this simple website to help other women—whether
      stay-at-home or working—organize household tasks and shopping needs with
      ease and clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is designed to make your life smoother. It includes weekly and
      monthly grocery lists, kitchen inventory tracking, and a collection of
      favorite household products—all in one organized space.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that with the right tools, we can save time, reduce stress, and
      focus on what really matters: taking care of our homes and families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore each section, and I hope this site becomes a useful
      part of your daily routine.
    </p>
    <p><strong>With care, Noor</strong></p>
